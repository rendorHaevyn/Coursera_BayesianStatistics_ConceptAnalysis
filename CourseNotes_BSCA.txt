== WEEK 1: PROBABILITY AND BAYE'S THEOREM ==

== PROBABILITY ==
* three main philosophies of probability and statistics: Bayesian and Frequentist and Classical

1. Classical: outcomes that are equally likely have equal probability.  This works well when we have equally likely outcomes, ie: roll of a die.

2. Frequentist: considers outcomes with respect to relative frequency; objective; requires us to have a hypothetical infinite sequence of events.  Assumes that we are sampling a population with a discrete distribution.

3. Bayesian: considers a personal perspective / judgement; subjective; 

1) In what ways could the frequentist paradigm be considered objective? In what ways could the Bayesian paradigm be considered objective?
* Frequentist objective: observational, creates conclusions based on evidence; Bayesian objective: uses a similar approach in that probabilities / estimates / conclusions are iteratively updated according to observation
* Frequentist paradigm: Counts events over a large number of trials rather than assessing belief. Bayesian: Updates beliefs based on actual information.

2) Identify ways in which each paradigm might be considered subjective.
* Bias is used to influence the probabilities / estimates / conclusions 
* Frequentist: Assumes that the sample of trials is representative of an infinite series of events. Also, this way of thinking about probabilities makes little sense when assessing the probability of a particular, unique event of occuring (e.g. chance of rain tomorrow). Bayesian: Starts from a prior belief, which may depend on the level of information of each observer or their view of the world.
